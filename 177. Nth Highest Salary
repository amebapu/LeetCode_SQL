Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+







Solution:



CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    set N = N-1;
    RETURN (SELECT DISTINCT(Salary) FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 1 offset N);
END

'''
same thing as #176, only difference is this is a function. Remember to set N = N - 1 with ';', since offset should be 
one step behind our actual N. Everything else is the same.
