Given a Weather table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.

+---------+------------------+------------------+
| Id(INT) | RecordDate(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
|       1 |       2015-01-01 |               10 |
|       2 |       2015-01-02 |               25 |
|       3 |       2015-01-03 |               20 |
|       4 |       2015-01-04 |               30 |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
For example, return the following Ids for the above Weather table:

+----+
| Id |
+----+
|  2 |
|  4 |
+----+




Solution:

select b.id
from weather a,
weather b
where TO_DAYS(b.RecordDate)-TO_DAYS(a.RecordDate)=1 and
a.temperature < b.temperature

'''
we just need to join the table with date difference 1 and temperature previous lower. 
one thing new here is the TO_DAYS() function, this function will return the date from year 0 to current date.
thus we just need the difference equal to 1. 
also, we can use datediff() function as well, it return the differnce between two dates, simpler
'''

select b.id
from weather a,
weather b
where datediff(b.RecordDate, a.RecordDate) = 1 and
a.temperature < b.temperature
