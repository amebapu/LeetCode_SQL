Solution 1: IS NULL

select name as Customers
from customers
left join orders on customers.id = orders.customerid
where orders.id is null

Solution 2: Sub Query

select customers.name as Customers
from customers
where customers.id not in
(select customerid from orders)

'''
my first thought is the solution one, using left join, then if customer has null value in orders.id,
they are Customers Who Never Order. 
the second solution is easy too, just found out those customer which are not in orders table using a subquery.
