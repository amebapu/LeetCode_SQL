The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

this is the time we need to apply self join. when we face questions like this, requiring two value from same table
to do some calculation or comparison, we should think about self join in the first place.
when self join, watch out which column to use to be the foreign key. for this one, we need connect employee with their 
managers.
