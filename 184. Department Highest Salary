The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.

+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
The Department table holds all departments of the company.

+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).

+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation:

Max and Jim both have the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.






Solution:


select b.Name as Department,
a.name as Employee,
a.Salary as Salary
from Employee a
join Department b on a.DepartmentId = b.Id
where (b.name, a.salary) 
in (select department.name, max(salary)
from employee
join department on departmentid = department.id
group by departmentid)

'''
First to find out the maximum salary in each dept. so we can get the code in above sub-query first. 
Then simply join our two lovely tables and match the department name and salary value with our combined tables 
to get the final result
