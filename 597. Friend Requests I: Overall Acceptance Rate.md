For the sample data above, your query should return the following result.
 

|accept_rate|
|-----------|
|       0.80|
 

Note:
The accepted requests are not necessarily from the table friend_request. In this case, you just need to simply count the total accepted requests (no matter whether they are in the original requests), and divide it by the number of requests to get the acceptance rate.
It is possible that a sender sends multiple requests to the same receiver, and a request could be accepted more than once. In this case, the ‘duplicated’ requests or acceptances are only counted once.
If there is no requests at all, you should return 0.00 as the accept_rate.
 

Explanation: There are 4 unique accepted requests, and there are 5 requests in total. So the rate is 0.80.



# Write your MySQL query statement below
select 
round (
    ifnull(
        (select count(*)
        from 
        (select distinct requester_id, accepter_id from request_accepted) as A)
        /
        (select count(*)
        from
        (select distinct sender_id, send_to_id from friend_request) as B)       
        , 0) 
,2) as accept_rate

这道题首先我们要搞清楚谁除以谁，因为是accept_rate，所以是接受的总量/发出的总量；
而且因为重复的不能计算在内，所以我们需要用select distinct；
又因为需要计算总量，我们可以用subquery先分离出unique的数据，再求count；
最后需要考虑的就是分母为0，所以我们用一个ifnull function，如果分母为0，就返回0；
最后的最后，select round(,2)
