Question: 
Given a table customer holding customers information and the referee.
Write a query to return the list of customers NOT referred by the person with id '2'.

Solution:
select name
from customer
where referee_id <> 2
or referee_id is null


'''
MySQL uses three-valued logic -- TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN. 
Anything compared to NULL evaluates to the third value: UNKNOWN. 
That “anything” includes NULL itself! 
That’s why MySQL provides the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators to specifically check for NULL.

Thus, one more condition 'referee_id IS NULL' should be added to the WHERE clause as below.
