'''
the main question here we need to use case when to sum the total cancellation times, no matter it's
from driver or user. thus like can be applied here. count(id) is the total rows of records we have, aka total population.
round(xxxxx, 2) give only two decimal remaining. 
always use '' to cover string, even thought some of them may be unnecessary, just to be 100% sure.
do not forget group by whenever we have agg function.
