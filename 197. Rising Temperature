'''
we just need to join the table with date difference 1 and temperature previous lower. 
one thing new here is the TO_DAYS() function, this function will return the date from year 0 to current date.
thus we just need the difference equal to 1. 
also, we can use datediff() function as well, it return the differnce between two dates, simpler
