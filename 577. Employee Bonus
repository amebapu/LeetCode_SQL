Question: Select all employee's name and bonus whose bonus is < 1000.

Answer:

select name, bonus
from employee e
left join bonus b
on e.empid = b.empid
where bonus < 1000 or bonus is null

'''
easy question, but things to keep in mind is that when we use bonus < 1000, it will not contain NULL value. NULL value
won't be used for comparison. Thus, we need to add bonus is null condition here.
