Table point holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.
 

Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.
 

| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |
 

The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:
 

| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |
 

Note: Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table point.
 

Follow-up: What if all these points have an id and are arranged from the left most to the right most of x axis?



# Write your MySQL query statement below
select min(abs(a.x - b.x)) as shortest
from point a
join point b
on a.x != b.x

因为只有一个col，立马就想到多半需要self join，然后构造出a和b两个col，再互相比较大小

| x  | x  | distance |
|----|----|----------|
| 0  | -1 | 1        |
| 2  | -1 | 3        |
| -1 | 0  | 1        |
| 2  | 0  | 2        |
| -1 | 2  | 3        |
| 0  | 2  | 2        |

注意self join的时候，on的条件要排除掉两个值相等的时候，不然最小值永远都是0
