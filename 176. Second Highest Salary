Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.
if no second highest, return null

'''
select 
ifnull(
(select distinct salary
from employee
order by salary desc
limit 1 offset 1), null)
as SecondHighestSalary

since we need to return null if no value, thus, IFNULL is a good function in MySQL to use.
IFNULL(expression, alt_value)
if the expression is not null, return expression
if the expression is null, return the alt_value
this is a good way to test null value in MySQL

the main part of this question is very simple. Just reverse the order and select the second one using limit 1 offset 1.
