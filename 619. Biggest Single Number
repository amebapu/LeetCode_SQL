Table my_numbers contains many numbers in column num including duplicated ones.
Can you write a SQL query to find the biggest number, which only appears once.

+---+
|num|
+---+
| 8 |
| 8 |
| 3 |
| 3 |
| 1 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 | 
For the sample data above, your query should return the following result:
+---+
|num|
+---+
| 6 |
Note:
If there is no such number, just output null.


# Write your MySQL query statement below
select max(num) as num
from 
(
    select num
    from my_numbers a
    group by num
    having count(*) = 1
) as b

就从理解题意的方向来解题，比如，我们首先要找到那些没有重复过的数字，那么就用group by 然后 count为1就行
然后，找出其中这些数字里面最大值，所以用个subquery就可以了
