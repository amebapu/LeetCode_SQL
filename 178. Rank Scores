I think this is the best solution for the question, unfortunately, it doesn't work on leetcode. DENSE_RANK is designed
to rank with no gap. if we want gap, we can use RANK. it's very simple question using those two functions.
after changing MySQL to SQL server it works. But that's just becuase the MySQL version is very old on leetcode.
