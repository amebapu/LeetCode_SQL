Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

FirstName, LastName, City, State


Solution:

select FirstName, LastName, City, State
from Person left join Address
on address.personid = person.personid


'''
simple question, the only thing needs to watch out is to use left join instead of join
since we want to keep all the students name
