Solution 1:

delete a 
from person a, person b
where a.email = b.email and a.id > b.id

'''
same thing as select cluse, just change select to delete. and remember to delete the larger id one.
'''


Solution 2:

Delete From Person
Where Id not in (
    Select minId From (
        Select min(Id) AS minId, Email
        From Person
        Group by Email
    ) AS tmp
);

'''
instead of join, we use subquery here to get the larger id of duplicate email;
one thing needs to be careful is when we are using subquery and updating table, the inner table may be changed while processing;
the below code is a bad example. we need a copy of the table to keep the inner table from deleting by outter delete cluse.
see above code.
'''

Delete From Person
Where Id not in (  
        Select min(Id)
        From Person
        Group by Email
);
