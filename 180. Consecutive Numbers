Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+
For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+




Solution:


select distinct t1.num as ConsecutiveNums
from 
    logs t1,
    logs t2,
    logs t3
where 
    t1.id = t2.id - 1 and
    t2.id = t3.id - 1 and
    t1.num = t2.num and
    t2.num = t3.num
    
    
'''
since we need to consider 3 consecutive same number in a row, so we can use the same table three times,
just make sure the id is in a consecutive way.
